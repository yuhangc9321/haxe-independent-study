### Inspiration
I first encountered Haxe when it was used in an entry to a game jam.
I looked into it and opinions of it were positive, although it's usage was somewhat niche.
I was also considering studying C# or something with databases, such as SQL.

## Haxe

### What is Haxe?
Haxe is a language that can compile to other languages, but one would need to know those languages first.
Haxe support includes C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, and some others.
It is mostly used for the development of games and applications.

### Related
OpenFL, HaxeFlixel and other frameworks and libraries can be used with Haxe.
OpenFL is a framework for creating applications.
HaxeFlixel is an engine for creating 2D games.

## Takeaways
1. Prior experience with other languages can help when learning a new language. Especially with this one, because otherwise the compiler output won't be readable.
2. Have an idea of what to make. I plan to create a web game using HaxeFlixel.
3. It doesn't hurt to explore. Take time to look around.
